<h4>Project no 1: HTML/CSS Conversion</h4>
<p>I converted a Figma design into a functional HTML and CSS layout, faithfully replicating the original design's elements and styles. Using HTML tags and CSS styling, I ensured pixel-perfect representation and responsiveness across devices. The result is a visually appealing and interactive web layout that matches the Figma design.</p>
